This 'fortress' mentality assumes that breaches can be stopped at the gate. However, in the age of AI-driven cyberattacks, this approach is obsolete. Preemptive cybersecurity represents a paradigm shift towards predictive defense. By utilizing AI agents that continuously simulate attacks on one's own network—a practice known as automated red-teaming—organizations can identify and fix weaknesses before an adversary exploits them. Furthermore, preemptive systems analyze global threat intelligence to forecast likely attack vectors based on geopolitical trends and hacker behavior patterns. Instead of building thicker walls, preemptive security focuses on immune system-like resilience, where the network constantly tests and strengthens itself against potential mutations of malware.\n\nSummary: While traditional cybersecurity relies on a (A)_________ strategy of responding to incidents after they occur, preemptive cybersecurity employs AI to (B)_________ vulnerabilities and strengthen defenses beforehand.",
