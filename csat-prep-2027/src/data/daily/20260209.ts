As AI agents evolve from passive tools to autonomous entities capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex objectives, they promise to liberate humans from mundane operational tasks. However, this liberation comes at the cost of opacity in decision-making chains. When an agent autonomously negotiates a contract or reroutes a global supply chain based on its own optimization logic, the human 'supervisor' may lose the granular context required to understand *why* a decision was made. Thus, as our digital tools become more capable of acting on our behalf, we paradoxically risk __________.",
